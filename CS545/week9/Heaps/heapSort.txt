build heap 2 method insert by pushing up and build from bottom up by push down
1.dont understand how min heap sort works, can you give me a example, why it reauires extra memory space? 3 1 7 2 5 4, it that means we create a new array, each time we call remove min we nned to put the removed min element at the begining of the array?
2.so want to insert into min heap is actually pushing up, build min heap bottom up is pusing down since we need removeMin(),
3.but when we build the max heap. build the max heap same way from buttom up means push down
4.do we need to upderstand the heap sort coding part using both min heap and max heap mehtod? do in the exam will only be graphs

steps of max heap sort
1.assume the max heap is already sorted
2.build the max heap from bottom up, and need to updated the indexes in the array when changeing element place
3.swap the root(greates value in max heap) with the max heap size(last element), and update array index (remove max and put on the end of array)
4.then need to reshape the max heap index after switching top and size and update array index after switching
5.reduced size
6.repeat the above step until we sort the heap.

steps for min heap sort——the original array will be sorted in the decending order
1.need to crete a new copied array
2.assume min heap is already sorted
3.build the min heap from bottom up (means find root element and compare with child, find smallest child and swap if child is smaller than root val)
4.swap the top/root(smallest elem) with size of heap (last element), and update index, (remove min), add the min in to beginning of copied array
5.reshape the min heap and updated index
6.reduce size
7.repeat and until the copied array is finshed and sorted
