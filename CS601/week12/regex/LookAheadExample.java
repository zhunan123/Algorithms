         The ?= is a specific type of non-capturing group known as a lookahead assertion.

         the current point in the regex for it to match, but it will not be captured and included
         in the list of matches. Essentially, ?= checks for a condition without consuming
         any characters in the string, so the matching engine's position within the string doesn't advance.

         a(?=b) means b must be followed after a but is not part of the capturing group or answer.
         so this b will not be captured and included in the list of matches
         in this case only matches a

         * (?=.{8,}): This is a positive lookahead that asserts that the following characters (at least 8 of them) exist from
         * the beginning of the string. . matches any character (except for line breaks), and {8,} means
         * at least 8 of those characters. This part ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
         *
         * (?=.*[A-Z]): This is another positive lookahead. .* means any character (.) 0 or more times (*), and [A-Z] means
         * any uppercase letter. This part ensures the password has at least one uppercase letter.
         *
         * (?=.*\d): Yet another positive lookahead. Here, \d represents any digit (0-9). Combined with .*,
         * it ensures the password has at least one digit.
         *
         * (?=.*[$%@#]): This is a positive lookahead similar to the previous ones, but [ and ] define a character set,
         * which in this case includes the special characters $, %, @, and #. This ensures the password
         * contains at least one of these special characters.
         *
         * (.*): Finally, this is not a lookahead, but a capturing group that captures the entire password. .* means any
         * character 0 or more times, so this part captures all characters in the password.
         *
         *
         (?=.{8,}) asserts that at the current position in the string, there must be 8 or more characters
         following it. This is a way to apply a condition to the entire string, saying "the string must be
         at least 8 characters long.

         (?=.{8,}): This is a positive lookahead assertion that ensures the string is at least 8 characters long.
         (?=.*[A-Z]): Ensures that there is at least one uppercase letter anywhere in the string.
         (?=.*\\d): Ensures that there is at least one digit anywhere in the string.
         (?=.*[$%@#]): Ensures that there is at least one special character from the set $, %, @, #.
         (.*): Matches any characters zero or more times, capturing the entire string.

         (?= ... ) is the positive lookahead assertion that tells the regex engine to
         look ahead in the string for a certain pattern without including that pattern in the overall match.
         .*[A-Z] within the lookahead means "match any sequence of characters followed by an uppercase letter".

         IMPORTANT====>
         positive lookahead must be followed by pattern ?=pattern
         .{8,} means start from position of any character, there are at lest 8 character includes and after this char
         I think (?=.{8,}) do not need to followed by anything since nothing before ?= and the patter .{8,} is any string has length of 8 or more
         (.{3,}) will match to rrr or rvb or psdfig89 but not rr has to be length 3 or more
         .{8,} means any string consist any character and have a length at least 8, below is any digits but with . is any character
         \\d{4} 1238 digits have length of 4 same stuff

         (?=.*[A-Z]) means [A-Z] can be appear any place at given string since [A-Z] can follows any char means and starting of string so means anywhere in the string
         so ?= is positive lookahead assertion,
         entire (?=.*[A-Z]) will check if a uppercase letter is in this given string

         if all (?=.{8,})(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[$%@#]) matches, this positive lookahead will not move current index or actual write anything, so still at beginning index
         then if all the positive lookahead passes, will execute (.*) from current position, .* matches any char 0 or more times
         here in this case will start at beginning
         each () in positive lookahead is separated and will be evaluated individually and not influence other () positive lookahead
         * */
        String regex = "(?=.{8,})(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[$%@#])(.*)"; // has an uppercase letter and a digit
