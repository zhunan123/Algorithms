* Dependency Injection
    -> pass reference class instance variable in as a props into another class
    -> loosely coupled
    -> Two class depends on each other
    -> hard wiring - bad
        -> do not create a object/instance variable of class B inside class A and use it - see spell check with hardWiring
        -> disadvantage? not flexible, what if you want to change later on
    -> we should inject/pass the class B(or the interface it implements) into the class A(pass into constructor)
    -> does not always has to be in the constructor, something you can inject it to a difference method.
